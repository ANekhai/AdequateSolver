# BPGraph
A class to handle breakpoint graphs in Java. 
Can read GRIMM formatted genome files and can store them as genome graphs and Multiple Breakpoint Graphs (requires Google Guava). 
Now also contains a fork of DCJStream (which is in turn a fork of ASMedian) to solve the Genome Median Problem exactly. This functionality is a work in progress and being tweaked.
