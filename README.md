# AdequateSolver
This project contains code to solve the GGHP and GAP with adequate subgraphs (still a WIP). Includes a class to handle breakpoint graphs in Java which can read GRIMM formatted genome files and can store them as genome graphs and Multiple Breakpoint Graphs (using google guava). Also contains a fork of DCJStream reimplemented with the modified breakpoint graphs to solve the GMP exactly (complete functionality with linear genomes is a WIP).
